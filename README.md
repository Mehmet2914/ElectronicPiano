# ElectronicPiano
Making an electronic piano by using Java to Arduino serial port communication. Designed interface in Java which seems like a piano.
When you click buttons data will be send to Arduino. There is 5v buzzer on my breadboard it connects with arduino pins. 
It plays musical tones and also plays mario songs. Please write any of your questions about project to mehmetmutlu2914@gmail.com
