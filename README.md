# ElectronicPiano
Making an electronic piano by using Java to Arduino serial (RS232) communication. First designed interface in Java which seems like a piano. When you click buttons data will be send to Arduino. Arduino reads data and creates suit frequency values to play notes. (Do,re,mi...) I used 5v buzzer for this project and connected it with arduino pins. Also this piano can play mario songs.
Please write any of your questions about project to mehmetmutlu2914@gmail.com
